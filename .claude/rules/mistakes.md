# Mistakes log — hard-learned bugs

Read this BEFORE touching:
- `src/js/auth.js`
- `src/js/db.js`
- Anything that calls supabase-js or `navigator.sendBeacon`

Each entry: **Symptom → Cause → Fix → Where it lives now**.

## supabase-js `onAuthStateChange` deadlocks every subsequent call

**Symptom**: After signing in, the next ~1 supabase call works. The one after
that hangs forever. User refresh fixes it. Repeats every login.
**Cause**: Known supabase-js bug (auth-js #762, ~2yr old). Any **async call to
supabase** inside the `onAuthStateChange` callback acquires the GoTrue session
lock and never releases it from the next caller's perspective. Subsequent
supabase calls queue forever.
**Fix**: Wrap the work in `setTimeout(() => { ... }, 0)` so it runs on the
next macrotask, after the auth callback has released its lock.
**Where**: `src/js/auth.js` `initAuth()`. **Do not remove the setTimeout.**

```js
db.auth.onAuthStateChange((_event, session) => {
  setTimeout(async () => {
    currentUser = await buildCurrentUser(session);  // ← this is a supabase call
    notify();
  }, 0);
});
```

## `navigator.sendBeacon` does not follow HTTP redirects

**Symptom**: Discord notifications stopped firing after switching `notify.js`
to sendBeacon. Apps Script execution log showed nothing — the request never
arrived.
**Cause**: Apps Script `/exec` URLs always 302-redirect to
`script.googleusercontent.com`. sendBeacon doesn't follow redirects.
**Fix**: Use plain `fetch(url, { keepalive: true, ... })` for GAS endpoints,
chain `.then(r => r.text())` to drain the body.
**Where**: `src/js/notify.js`. **Don't go back to sendBeacon for GAS endpoints.**

---

## supabase-js autoRefreshToken can stall, blocking subsequent requests

**Symptom**: Second form submit hangs 30s, times out. Reproduces ~hourly
(token TTL).
**Cause**: When the JWT nears expiry, supabase-js fires an inline refresh
before the next request. If that refresh stalls (network blip, Supabase
slowness), every queued request waits.
**Fix**: Disable `autoRefreshToken` in the client config and call
`db.auth.refreshSession()` on a 25-min `setInterval` instead.
**Where**: `src/js/db.js`.

```js
createClient(url, anon, {
  auth: {
    persistSession: true,
    autoRefreshToken: false,   // ← do not re-enable
    detectSessionInUrl: true,
  },
});
setInterval(() => db.auth.refreshSession().catch(...), 25 * 60 * 1000);
```

## Ticket renderers interpolate user-text into innerHTML → XSS

**Symptom**: A guest who submits a PR/VS ticket with `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`
in any free-text field (brief, caption, rushReason, otherPlatformReason,
contentName, contact, problem, remark, …) pops scripts at every staff
viewer of that ticket.
**Cause**: Renderers like `renderPRDashboard`, `renderPRHistoryList`,
`renderUserHistoryList`, `renderTimeline`, the VS staff kanban, and
`renderManageAgentsList` build their HTML with template literals and
`insertAdjacentHTML` / `innerHTML`. Any user-text field interpolated
raw is an XSS hole.
**Fix**: Use `escHtml` from `utils.js` for any text field. Use `safeUrl`
for any URL going into an `href` attribute (blocks `javascript:`,
`data:`, attribute-injection payloads). The only string that may go
through innerHTML *raw* is Quill-produced rich text (announcement
content + VS problem field) — both are explicitly trusted.
**Where**: applied in `src/js/pr-tracking.js`, `pr-staff.js`,
`vs-tracking.js`, `vs-staff.js`, `utils.js renderTimeline`,
`announcements.js`. Don't add a new renderer without an `escHtml`
audit.

## supabase-js silent-success on RLS-blocked updates / deletes

**Symptom**: User clicks "Update announcement" → success message → opens the
announcement → old content. Update silently did nothing. Same shape for
staff status updates, ticket deletes, agent roster saves, user dept set.
**Cause**: `db.from().update().eq(...)` and `.delete().eq(...)` return
`{ data: null, error: null }` when zero rows are touched (RLS blocks, id
mismatch). No error to catch.
**Fix**: Use `dbRest()` from `db.js` with `prefer: 'return=representation'`
and check `data.length`. If 0, throw a real error.
**Where it lives now**: every write that matters is on dbRest —
- `src/js/announcements.js` `publishAnnouncement()`
- `src/js/pr-staff.js` `submitPRStaffAction()` / `deletePRStaffAction()` / `saveGlobalAgents()`
- `src/js/vs-staff.js` `submitStaffAction()`
- `src/js/vs-tracking.js` `submitUserRemark()`
- `src/js/auth.js` `setDepartment()`

**Don't bring back `db.from().update/delete` for any write that matters.**
If a new write site appears, use `dbRest()` and verify `data.length > 0`.

## Synthetic email domain must be a real public TLD

**Symptom**: Registration fails with `Email address "x@samomdkku.local" is invalid`.
**Cause**: Supabase Auth rejects RFC 6762 reserved TLDs (`.local`, `.localhost`).
**Fix**: Use `samomdkku.app` (real public TLD; we don't actually own it but
the format passes validation; no mail delivers).
**Where**: `src/js/auth.js` `PASSWORD_EMAIL_DOMAIN` and
`supabase/migrations/0002_seed_staff_accounts.sql`. Do not switch back.

---

## `form.reset()` clears hidden inputs

**Symptom**: First PR submit succeeds; second submit goes through with
`submitter = 'Guest'` even though user is signed in.
**Cause**: After success, we call `form.reset()` to clear visible fields.
This also resets hidden inputs `prGoogleUserEmail` / `prGoogleUserName`.
**Fix**: Re-populate hidden inputs from `authGetUser()` immediately after reset.
**Where**: `src/js/pr-form.js` success path inside `handlePrFormSubmit`.

---

## supabase-js gets into a bad state — bypass with `dbRest()`

**Symptom**: After one supabase-js call succeeds, the next one hangs. Even
selects, even on different tables. autoRefresh disabled, deadlock workaround
in place, still hangs.
**Cause**: Unidentified residual state in the supabase-js client.
**Fix**: For any call that has to be reliable, use the `dbRest()` helper in
`src/js/db.js` — it's raw fetch + AbortController against PostgREST, with the
same auth headers supabase-js would send.
**Where**: Use `dbRest('/table?...', { method, body, prefer })` everywhere
that previously hung. PR tracking and announcements use it now.

---

## Email confirmation must be OFF in Supabase for synthetic emails

**Symptom**: Registration hits `Email rate limit exceeded` after 3 attempts.
**Cause**: Supabase tries to send a confirmation email to `@samomdkku.app`
which doesn't deliver. Each attempt counts toward the rate limit (3/hour
on free tier built-in SMTP).
**Fix**: Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Email →
toggle off "Confirm email". Synthetic emails don't need confirmation; Google
users come in via OAuth which is already verified.

---

## Bootstrap tab JS keeps the parent dropdown open

**Symptom**: After clicking "PR Form" inside the "เครื่องมือ" dropdown, the
dropdown stays open and the toggle stays styled active.
**Cause**: Bootstrap's tab JS directly sets `.show` on the parent
`.dropdown-menu`, bypassing the Dropdown API — so `.hide()` doesn't help.
**Fix**: Listen for `shown.bs.tab`. Strip `.show` from any `.dropdown-menu.show`
inside `.samo-navbar` and reset `aria-expanded="false"` on the toggle.
**Where**: `src/js/main.js`.

---

## Bootstrap mobile offcanvas + `data-bs-toggle="pill"` race

**Symptom**: On mobile, tapping a tool in the offcanvas drawer activates the
new pane on top of the old one (stacked panes).
**Cause**: The offcanvas pill buttons aren't part of the navbar's tablist, so
Bootstrap activates the new pane but never deactivates the previously-active
one.
**Fix**: In the offcanvas, drop `data-bs-toggle="pill"` and use
`onclick="activateTab('pills-X-tab')"` which routes through the canonical
tab button (in the right tablist). Close offcanvas in a delegated click
handler.
**Where**: `src/html/navbar.html` + `src/js/main.js`.

---

## `form.reset()` clears the file input but `fileInput.files` still references the old File

Not currently biting us, but worth knowing: after `form.reset()`, the file
input element's `.files` property may still reference the previously-selected
file in some browsers. If you trigger an upload in a second submission and
read `fileInput.files`, you can re-upload the previous file. Re-create the
input element OR explicitly `fileInput.value = ''` if this becomes a problem.

---

## HTML5 `required` on a hidden field silently blocks form submit

**Symptom**: User fills in every visible field of the project send-document
modal, clicks "ส่ง" — nothing happens. No error, no spinner, no Discord
ping, no row. DevTools console quietly says
`An invalid form control with name='' is not focusable.`
**Cause**: The same `<form>` does double duty for "create project + first
doc" and "add doc to existing project". Depending on mode, half its fields
are hidden via `d-none`. But HTML5 form validation **still runs on hidden
required fields** — and because the browser can't focus a hidden field to
show the validation tooltip, it just refuses to submit, silently.
**Fix**: Add `novalidate` to the `<form>` AND remove all `required`
attributes from inputs that may be hidden by mode. Do validation in JS
(`onSubmit` throws clear Thai errors that surface via `alert`). HTML5
required + dynamic hide/show is a footgun in any multi-mode form here.
**Where**: `src/html/modal-project-send.html` `#projectSendForm`. If you
add a new dual-mode modal, do the same.

---

## Check constraint must be dropped BEFORE updating to a new enum value

**Symptom**: Running a migration that renames enum values fails with
`ERROR: new row for relation "X" violates check constraint "X_col_check"`
on the `UPDATE` statement itself — even though that UPDATE's whole job
is to move the values to the new set.
**Cause**: PostgreSQL evaluates check constraints on every row mutation.
If the migration UPDATEs to a value that's outside the OLD check, the
update fails before the new ALTER … ADD CHECK runs.
**Fix**: Always `ALTER TABLE … DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS X_check` **before**
`UPDATE … SET col = new_value`, then `ALTER TABLE … ADD CONSTRAINT X_check
CHECK (col IN (new_set))` afterwards. Also broaden the UPDATE to
`WHERE col NOT IN (new_set)` so a re-run / unexpected legacy value
doesn't get left in an invalid state.
**Where**: `supabase/migrations/0007_shop_refactor.sql` for the shop
`source` enum (md/rt/mdi/sittikao). Apply this pattern to any future
enum-rename migration.

---

## RLS inline subqueries silently depend on the referenced table's RLS

**Symptom**: Per-dept VP gate stops returning rows after someone tightens
an unrelated RLS policy on `public.users` (e.g. restricting `users_read_all`
to self-row only). No error — the dashboard just goes blank for VPs.
**Cause**: Policies like `vs_tickets_read` (0010), `vs_tickets_update_staff`
(0013), `vs_tickets_delete_staff` (0015) used
`target_dept = (select department from public.users where id = auth.uid())`
inline. That subquery runs under the *caller's* RLS, not as `security definer`.
It worked only because `users_read_all` (0001) was wide-open. The coupling
is invisible from the policy body.
**Fix**: For any cross-table lookup used in an RLS predicate, wrap it in a
helper function with `language sql stable security definer set search_path = public`
and `grant execute … to anon, authenticated`. Same pattern as the existing
`current_user_role()` / `current_user_has_permission()` helpers. The dept
lookup is now `public.current_user_dept()` (migration 0016).
**Where**: `current_user_dept()` defined in `0016_current_user_dept_helper.sql`;
all three `vs_tickets` policies repointed there. Don't reintroduce inline
`(select … from public.users where id = auth.uid())` in any new policy.

---

## Hardcoded reserved-username lists rot when new staff accounts are added

**Symptom**: Registration form lets a public visitor try
`samomdkkuradiology` (or any of the 9 VP usernames added in 0010/0011).
Backend uniqueness on `public.users.username` returns
"Username นี้มีผู้ใช้งานแล้ว" — but only IF the VP auth user has already
been seeded. If not, the visitor squats the name and the admin can't
seed the legitimate account.
**Cause**: `auth.js registerWithPassword` had a literal list of 6 reserved
usernames. Every time a new `samomdkku*` staff account is added (per-VP,
new dept, future role) the list goes out of date. `reserved_staff_usernames`
is reference-only (0011 itself comments "not load-bearing"), so the only
defence is the username unique constraint *if* the row exists.
**Fix**: Use a prefix check — `/^samomdkku/.test(lc) || lc === 'sastaff'`.
The repo's convention is that ALL staff accounts share the `samomdkku`
prefix; literal lists shouldn't be added.
**Where**: `src/js/auth.js` `registerWithPassword`. Don't reintroduce
the literal list. If a future non-prefix staff username is needed,
extend the regex / OR clause — don't fall back to literals.

## iOS Safari `100vh` hides the bottom of a full-height drawer

**Symptom**: Sign-out button (or any bottom-anchored control) in the
mobile admin sidebar drawer was unreachable on iPhone — buried under
Safari's bottom URL chrome.
**Cause**: iOS Safari measures `100vh` against the *large viewport*
(URL bar hidden). When the URL bar is shown — which is the default
state on first open — the drawer extends *past* the visible area, and
the user has to scroll to reach the bottom. Adding `bottom: 0` on a
fixed element doesn't help: the element is positioned relative to the
same large viewport.
**Fix**: Use `100dvh` (dynamic viewport height) for the drawer height,
which shrinks when the chrome is shown. Keep `100vh` above it as a
fallback for browsers that don't grok `dvh`. Additionally pad the bottom
of the bottom-anchored control with
`max(0.85rem, calc(env(safe-area-inset-bottom) + 0.6rem))` so it sits
above the iOS home-indicator inset too.
**Where**: `src/css/workspace.css` `.workspace-side` (mobile @media block)
+ `.workspace-side-foot` (same block). Apply the same pattern to any
new full-height mobile overlay (offcanvas, modal-fullscreen on mobile).

## When in doubt: check `mistakes.md` before re-implementing

Every entry above represents hours we already spent. If a symptom looks
similar to something here, the fix is probably the same or related.
