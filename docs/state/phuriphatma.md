# phuriphatma — session notes

One file per person, as designed in `docs/TEAM-WORKFLOW.md` §6.5. **Write your
own; never rewrite someone else's.**

What belongs here: what I am part-way through, what I tried that did not work,
what I want to pick up next. What does NOT belong here:

- a rule that will still be true next year → `docs/INVARIANTS.md`
- what is true right now for everyone → `STATE.md`
- why something was done the way it was → `docs/state-archive/`
- a bug that was fixed → `docs/mistakes/<area>.md`, then `npm run mistakes:index`

The dead-pointer sweep in `state-handoff.test.js` runs over this file too, so a
path named here must resolve.

## ▶ Golden Period — BUILT, SHIPPED, LIVE

✅ **Built as `3b92df5`, deployed in `7405712`, and two deploys behind us now.**
No deploy is owed for it. This block said "DEPLOY IS OWED" for a day after it
had gone out — never trust a deploy claim in a hand-written file; run
`npm run deploy:owed`, which reads the one sha in `STATE.md` and answers from
the working tree.

If you ever do need to verify it in a served bundle, the marker is the string
`gp-tab` or `ช่วงเวลาที่เหมาะกับการจัดกิจกรรม`, NOT a function name (the
minifier renames those).

What shipped: `/tools/golden-period` under **ฝ่ายยุทธศาสตร์และพัฒนาองค์กร**
(`strategy` — NOT `admin`; that was a wrong guess from a screenshot, corrected
by the owner). วิธีอ่านค่า as four bands, the สโมฯ calendar embedded, a button
to the GPC Dashboard sheet, and a release note in `PENDING`.

**Verified in headless Chrome at 390 px and 1280 px** (`skills/drive-the-browser.md`):
pane activates from the route, calendar mode is AGENDA on the phone and MONTH on
desktop, the band dot is actually painted, no horizontal overflow, no console
errors, and the calendar returns real data.

📌 **It is the file the ฝ่าย open a PR against, not a placeholder to replace.**
Its header says so in Thai and names what is safe to change. `id="gpCalendar"`
and the `.gp-tab` class are the two things that must not move.

⚠️ **`dept-tool-mirror.test.js` is new** — every ฝ่าย tool must be findable in
the launcher, because `DEPT_DEFS` and `tab-tools.html` are still two
hand-maintained copies. The real fix remains the single registry
(`docs/DEPT-TOOLS.md` §2).

## ▶ ASKED FOR AND NOT DONE — pick these up first

1. **A `DEV` folder inside `IT Database` on Drive.** The owner asked for it
   (2026-08-27) and it was never created — the Discord webhook incident took the
   rest of the session. Parent folder id: **`1_VQXAVh4ZMoj7_TLiHJFe4HM223Q0oLW`**.
   Purpose: a dev Apps Script deployment writes uploads there instead of into the
   real tree (`docs/TEAM-WORKFLOW.md` §1). ⚠️ The clasp token on this machine is
   `drive.file` + `drive.metadata.readonly` and EXPIRES hourly, so it may not be
   able to create inside a folder it did not make — **it is 30 seconds by hand in
   the Drive UI**, and that is the sane path.

2. **The dev Apps Script deployment.** `samoweb` (`1lENmMdToG_P…`) is the LIVE
   one — confirmed by matching its deployment v11 to the `/exec` id in
   `src/js/config.js`. A dev copy should live under **its own Google account** so
   its credential reaches nothing real (`.claude/rules/security.md` explains why:
   `prform.gs` uses `DriveApp`, so re-authorising grants the whole Drive).

3. **Answer given, not acted on: a mail server on the VM.** The owner asked. The
   answer is **do not host real mail** — deliverability, blocklists and spam
   handling are a permanent job. But the plan does not want real mail: it wants a
   **trap**. Run **Mailpit** on the VM (one static binary, a fake SMTP that
   captures everything and shows a web inbox), point `samo-dev`'s SMTP at it, and
   sign-up / reset / email-change become testable without a single message
   reaching a student. That closes the last of phase 2 besides the GAS work.

## In flight

- ✅ **The database password is in `.env.local` and verified.** Schema dumped:
  64 tables, 165 functions, 156 policies, 592 GRANTs. Recipe and traps in
  `skills/build-the-dev-database.md`. **The dump is a build artifact and is NOT
  in the repo** — it lives in the session scratchpad and goes stale; re-run the
  dump rather than reusing an old file.
- ✅ **`samo-dev` is BUILT, LOADED and PROVEN** (`xibugtlsphcfuvstnxxh`).
  Rebuild any time with `CONFIRM=1 npm run dev:refresh`; check it with
  `npm run dev:check`. Credentials are the `SUPABASE_DEV_*` block in
  `.env.local` and are safe to share with the team — that account holds nothing
  but disposable projects.
- **The one-source tool registry is un-started** — `src/data/tools.js`,
  `docs/DEPT-TOOLS.md` §13. (This bullet used to read "Golden Period is
  un-started", contradicting the top of this same file; the PAGE shipped, the
  REGISTRY did not.) `DEPT_DEFS` in `src/js/departments.js` and
  `src/html/tab-tools.html` are still two hand-maintained copies of one list,
  held in step only by `dept-tool-mirror.test.js`.

## Next time I have an hour

- The project board (the last outstanding piece of `TEAM-WORKFLOW` phase 0).
- ~~Decide whether previews are per-PR or one always-on dev site.~~ **DECIDED
  and BUILT: per-pull-request, on Cloudflare Pages** (`docs/TEAM-WORKFLOW.md`
  §1, D8), proven end to end on 2026-08-27. Left here struck through because a
  session re-opened it from this very bullet and wasted a round trip.
