// team0135-name-split.mjs — the split reaches all three, and nothing guesses.
//
// 0135 closes the one gap 0132/0133 left open: a name edited in ทีม SAMO could
// not reach ระบบบ้าน, because ทีม SAMO stored one string and ระบบบ้าน stores two,
// and the only way to convert is to guess where the surname starts.
//
// ALLOW — the split propagates in every direction:
//   A1  parts written on team_members derive full_name
//   A2  a ทีม SAMO split edit reaches the registry AS A SPLIT
//   A3  …and lands in ระบบบ้าน (this is the gap that was open)
//   A4  a ระบบบ้าน split edit lands in ทีม SAMO as two columns + the whole
//   A5  update_my_identity writes the split without reconstructing it
//   A6  a member may edit their OWN ชื่อ / นามสกุล (the allow-list grew)
//   A7  get_my_team_seat() publishes the two new keys
//
// DENY — nothing manufactures a boundary:
//   D1  a COMBINED edit in ทีม SAMO never overwrites a person's SPLIT
//   D2  …and never overwrites ระบบบ้าน's first_name_th either
//   D3  a legacy combined name is not blanked by an unrelated edit
//   D4  sai_code is still never mirrored (0132's invariant, re-checked because
//       this migration rewrote both mirrors)
//   D5  a member still may NOT edit an admin-owned column
//
// The deny half is the point. Every failure this migration exists to prevent is
// a WRITE THAT SUCCEEDS with the wrong value, so a probe that only checks that
// syncing works would pass on the broken version too.
//
// Runs inside a transaction it ROLLS BACK.

-- A6 / D5 — the self-update guard. Two directions, because a probe that can
-- only report "denied" cannot tell a working guard from a broken connection.
-- Impersonate a member with NO admin grant, or the guard returns early and both
-- halves pass vacuously. 'permissions' AND 'managed_permissions' are both
-- checked: an account picked on 'permissions = '{}'' alone may hold master
-- through the ทีม SAMO tree (0081) and would look exactly like a fail-open.
--
-- No such account exists today — every member with a login holds something —
-- so the subject is MANUFACTURED inside the transaction rather than searched
-- for. That is the difference between a test and a test that reports "nothing
-- to check" and gets read as a pass: the first version of this probe printed
-- 'ok (no plain member to test)' for both halves, which is exactly the shape of
-- a proof that protects nothing.
-- The subject must genuinely LACK team_edit, or the guard returns early and
-- both halves pass without testing anything. 102 of the 116 members with a
-- login qualify.
--
-- Note the filter reads the UNION of 'permissions' AND 'managed_permissions'
-- (0081) — an account picked on 'permissions' alone may hold the grant through
-- the ทีม SAMO tree, which reads exactly like a fail-open policy and is the
-- grant engine working. And note what this does NOT do: stripping the columns
-- to manufacture a subject is refused by users_self_update_guard
-- ('tree-managed columns are server-managed'), which is the correct answer —
-- a real subject is better than a synthetic one anyway.
