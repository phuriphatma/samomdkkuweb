-- dept0177-page-scope.sql — a ฝ่าย edits its OWN page and nobody else's.
--
-- 0177 lets a ฝ่าย edit its page content in the app instead of asking IT for a
-- commit. The whole safety of that rests on one predicate,
-- `current_user_dept_page_scope()`, so this proof asks it from four different
-- identities over the same rows.
--
-- WHY BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE MANDATORY. "The editor can write" is half a property:
-- a policy that was dropped entirely also lets the editor write. The half that
-- says the scope is real is that the SAME editor is refused on ANOTHER ฝ่าย's
-- row, and that a signed-in account with no grant is refused everywhere. A
-- deny-only probe cannot tell a working guard from a broken service, and an
-- allow-only probe cannot tell a scope from `using (true)`.
--
-- THE SUBJECTS ARE CREATED, NOT FOUND. This grant is new, so nobody holds it
-- yet and a proof that searched for a holder would be vacuously green for as
-- long as it took someone to be granted — green while broken. Where a scenario
-- can be absent, CREATE it (docs/mistakes/tooling-proofs.md). Everything is
-- undone: writes raise inside their own subtransaction and the file rolls back.

-- ── §C the COLUMN guard: a row cannot be walked to another ฝ่าย ─────────────
-- Class 1: a per-row UPDATE policy gates WHICH ROW and then grants every column
-- in it — including `dept`. So an editor could keep one of their own rows and
-- change its ฝ่าย, landing their content on a page they may not touch. The
-- `with check` clause is what refuses that, and this is the only assertion that
-- can tell whether the clause is doing anything.
--
-- ⚠️ IT MUST BE THE **VISIBLE** ROW, AND THE FIRST DRAFT USED THE HIDDEN ONE.
-- That version passed against `with check (true)` — a guard that fails green.
-- Measured cause: when a HIDDEN row is moved out of the editor's scope, the new
-- row satisfies neither SELECT policy (not visible=true, no longer their ฝ่าย),
-- so Postgres refuses it whatever the UPDATE policy says. The assertion was
-- reading that refusal and scoring the column guard as present. On a visible
-- row — which is what ฝ่าย page content normally is — the same statement
-- SUCCEEDS the moment the check is weakened. Falsified both ways before this
-- line was trusted.
