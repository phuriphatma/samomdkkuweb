-- ============================================================
-- pr0149-delete-permission.sql — does soft_delete_pr_ticket() honour the SAME
-- authorization as the DELETE policy it says it mirrors?
--
-- THIS IS A DIFFERENTIAL TEST. `soft_delete_pr_ticket` restates
-- `pr_tickets_delete_staff` in a second place (0043 chose an RPC precisely so
-- the soft-delete would not inherit the broader UPDATE policy), and two
-- implementations of one rule drift — which is exactly what happened: 0014 had
-- already added `current_user_has_permission('pr')` to the policy, 0043 was
-- written from 0001's pr_staff/dev-only version, and the RPC never learned the
-- permission channel. So every case below asks what the POLICY decides, then
-- asks what the RPC decides, and compares.
--
-- Both directions, because both are silent when wrong: a DENY-only probe cannot
-- tell a working guard from a broken service, and an ALLOW-only probe cannot see
-- a gate that has stopped gating.
--
-- Every subject is RESOLVED FROM THE DATA, never hardcoded — a proof whose
-- subject is a person's name rots the moment the org chart moves.
--
-- 0168 WIDENED THIS PROOF, because it widened what the drift was. The same rule
-- was spelled FOUR times, not two — pr_tickets_read's third branch,
-- pr_tickets_update_staff, pr_tickets_delete_staff and the RPC — and all four
-- now call one predicate, public.current_user_can_manage_pr(). So:
--
--   §A/§B/§C  behavioural, unchanged in shape: read / update / delete / rpc,
--             three subjects each, allow AND deny, every gate compared.
--   §D        STRUCTURAL, new: there is exactly ONE implementation. It fails if
--             a site stops calling the predicate, or starts spelling the rule
--             out again beside it. Behaviour alone cannot see that — four
--             identical copies agree perfectly right up until one is edited.
--
-- Each instrument UNDOES ITSELF by raising inside its own subtransaction, so
-- nothing here depends on the outer rollback and no probe row is lost to a
-- `rollback to savepoint` (which discards the temp-table insert as well).
