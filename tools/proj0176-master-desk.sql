-- ============================================================
-- proj0176-master-desk.sql — a `master` works the ผู้ส่ง desk, and the
-- professor's column guard still holds against an actual professor.
--
-- WHAT WENT WRONG (0176). 0111 folds `master` into
-- current_user_project_seats() as {vpa,staff,prof} so a master can work any
-- of the three desks. Every other reader of current_user_is_prof() is an OR
-- branch in a policy, where an extra `true` only widens. The two BEFORE
-- UPDATE column guards are RESTRICTIONS, and they read the extra prof desk
-- as a disqualification: all 41 master holders could change NOTHING on a
-- หนังสือ except a comment. Reported as "can't ซ่อนจากเว็บ on each หนังสือ"
-- because that is the button a ผู้ส่ง reaches for; status, title and note
-- were equally dead.
--
-- WHY BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE MANDATORY HERE. The guard is the ONLY thing
-- stopping a professor from rewriting a หนังสือ — project_documents_update
-- admits him at ROW level and a row-level policy grants every column in the
-- row (class 1). So "master can now write" is half the property; "a
-- prof-only account still cannot" is the half that says the fix widened the
-- guard instead of deleting it. §A and §B are that pair over the same
-- columns.
--
-- SUBJECTS ARE RESOLVED FROM GRANTS, NEVER NAMED. A proof pinned to a person
-- rots the day the org chart moves (docs/mistakes/tooling-proofs.md).
--
-- Nothing is left changed: every write raises inside its own subtransaction
-- to undo itself, and the whole file rolls back.
