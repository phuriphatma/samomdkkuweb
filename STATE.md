# STATE — current task & latest known state

Last updated: 2026-06-03 (later session). Slim by design — "what is true right now",
not a project diary. Session narratives live in `git log`; architecture
in `docs/CONTEXT.md`; bug post-mortems in `.claude/rules/mistakes.md`.

Build green, 49 tests pass (`npm test`). `main` HEAD now lands the
**Samoshop per-item overhaul** (merged from `feat/shop-per-item-progress`):
order status = payment phase, `shop_order_items.item_status` =
produce→ready→done per product (Hybrid model); multi-slip + required
buyer phone + IG contact banner; grid "เหลือ N" count hidden (kept in
the product modal); admin orders table redesigned (Product/Qty columns,
per-item rows, live filtered count); admin order create + edit-items +
per-item preorder toggle; status changes write immediately (no Save bar);
new พรีออเดอร์ demand tab; การส่งมอบ tab removed. Plus a footer
แหล่งข้อมูล column (SAMO Academic DB / MDI / RT links). Earlier `main`
work (ฝ่าย nav, tab-departments, /projects-view mirror gated by 0032,
copy-รหัส button) is still in. Cloudflare auto-build runs on push.

## Branches

- `main` HEAD: latest production. Auto-deploys to `samomdkkuweb.pages.dev`.
- `refactor/modular`: synced to main (preview). Auto-deploys to
  `refactorsamomdkkuweb.pages.dev`.
- `feat/batch-shop-account-banners-fixes` (in flight, NOT merged): shop
  checkout required-field `*` markers; mobile launch-banner peek fix;
  `mistakes.md` trimmed under budget (+ `mistakes-archive.md`); จัดการบัญชี
  contact phone + samoshop autofill (mig 0036); admin order size/colour
  dropdowns; ประกาศ swipe-banner carousel + admin placement toggle
  (mig 0037); account-switch slow-path now uses local-scope signout so
  the outgoing account stays fast-switchable. Plus: reserved stock
  excludes preorder (mig 0038); admin orders table filter narrows to
  matching line items + new product-type/subtype facet; พรีออเดอร์ tab
  redesigned (summary stats + table view + search/type filters).
  **Apply 0036 + 0037 + 0038 before merge/use.**

## Pending DB migrations (Supabase `fheueuowbchsnsvbcgil`)

Apply in numeric order via the SQL editor. JS callers degrade gracefully
when missing — site keeps working but the feature behind each migration
won't function until applied.

User has confirmed 0023–0031 + **0033–0035 are applied**. **0032 is
still pending** — until it lands, the new /projects-view customer mirror
will show empty (anon SELECT blocked by the existing actor-gated read
policies).

| Migration | What it unlocks | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0023_shop_product_code | `<CODE>NNNN` order ids; `shop_products.code` | ✅ applied |
| 0024_shop_product_production_status | `production_status` column + cascade RPC | ✅ applied |
| 0025_shop_orders_paid_cascade | BEFORE-UPDATE trigger auto-advances on `paid` | ✅ applied |
| 0026_profile_email_and_order_contact | `lookup_email_by_username` RPC; auth.email mirror; `buyer_name`/`buyer_email` | ✅ applied |
| 0027_username_case_and_has_password | Case-insensitive username lookup; `users.has_password` mirror | ✅ applied |
| 0028_users_self_update_guard | **Security**. BEFORE-UPDATE trigger that blocks self-promotion via `PATCH /users` (column-level guard since RLS is row-level only) | ✅ applied |
| 0029_shop_preorder_price | `shop_products.preorder_price` nullable column — separate preorder price | ✅ applied |
| 0030_shop_stock_safety_and_preorder_tag | `shop_orders.is_preorder` + `shop_reserved_matrix_all()` RPC + `place_shop_order()` RPC (atomic stock check via row lock — prevents oversell). Buyer sees `max(0, stock - reserved)`. | ✅ applied |
| 0031_project_doc_views | Per-user, per-doc seenAt marker — moves inbox highlights off per-device localStorage so they sync across devices + stop leaking across accounts. RLS-gated to own rows. JS bulk-uploads existing localStorage on first run. (File made idempotent after the first apply — re-running is safe.) | ✅ applied |
| 0032_projects_public_read | **Public-read RLS** on `projects`, `project_documents`, `project_files`, `project_doc_types`, `project_settings` (`for select to anon, authenticated using (true)`). Unblocks the new /projects-view customer mirror — anonymous visitors can list every project, document, file URL, and the settings row's label fields. Writes are unchanged (still vp_admin / uni_staff gated). Settings table now exposes `uni_email` to anon too — if that becomes sensitive, scope to a column-select view in a follow-up. | ⏳ **pending — apply via Supabase SQL editor** |
| 0033_shop_per_item_and_buyer_phone | **Additive**. `shop_order_items.item_status`/`item_timeline`/`is_preorder`; `shop_orders.buyer_phone` + `slips` jsonb (backfilled from `slip_url`). Foundation for the Hybrid per-item model. | ✅ applied |
| 0034_shop_item_status_cascade | Rewrites `place_shop_order` (adds `p_buyer_phone`/`p_slips`, stamps per-item `is_preorder` + seeds `item_status`), repoints `apply_product_production_status` + the order-paid trigger to cascade to `item_status`, moves reserved-matrix aggregates to an item-level predicate. Drops the 0030 `place_shop_order` signature. | ✅ applied |
| 0035_shop_orders_admin_insert | Admin `shop_orders` INSERT policy so admin can create walk-in / phone orders (buyer_id null). OR-combined with the buyer insert policy. | ✅ applied |
| 0036_users_phone | **Additive**. `users.phone` column (self-writable; not guarded by 0028). Powers the จัดการบัญชี phone field + samoshop checkout autofill. | ⏳ **pending — apply via Supabase SQL editor** |
| 0037_shop_banner_placement | **Additive**. `shop_banners.placement` ('launch' \| 'announcement', default 'launch'); per-placement order index. Unlocks the ประกาศ swipe-banner carousel + admin placement toggle. | ⏳ **pending — apply via Supabase SQL editor** |
| 0038_reserved_excludes_preorder | Redefines `shop_reserved_matrix`, `shop_reserved_matrix_all`, `place_shop_order` so reserved-stock aggregates count only `is_preorder=false` items — preorder no longer depletes finite stock / over-counts the oversell guard. Signatures unchanged. | ⏳ **pending — apply via Supabase SQL editor** |

## Supabase config notes

- Authentication → Providers → Email → **Confirm email: OFF**. Flipping
  ON breaks signup at the project-wide email rate limit because every
  synthetic `<user>@samomdkku.app` bounces a verification email. See
  `mistakes.md` "Email confirmation must be OFF for synthetic emails"
  for the longer story + the implications for the profile email-add
  flow (`db.auth.updateUser({email})` writes immediately, ownership
  proof is the subsequent `linkIdentity` Google OAuth round-trip).
- Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs include both
  `https://samomdkkuweb.pages.dev/**` and
  `https://refactorsamomdkkuweb.pages.dev/**`.

## Pending GAS redeploy (`appscript/prform.gs`)

The local `prform.gs` is multiple commits ahead of what's deployed
to the prod /exec endpoint. See `skills/deploy-gas.md` for the deploy
procedure. Bundled changes since the last deploy:

| Area | What's new |
|---|---|
| QR + folder ops | New `getProjectFolderInfo` action (takes optional `share:true` for ANYONE_WITH_LINK view — QR sets it, rename hook doesn't). New `walkProjectsPathByCode_` + `extractProjectCode_` helpers: every project-tree path walk now matches folders by their PRJ-/DOC- code substring and self-renames stale names to the current desiredName. Used by `handleUploadProjectFile`, `handleGetProjectFolderInfo`, `handleDeleteProjectFolder` — so a project / doc rename in the app self-heals on Drive on the next upload, QR generation, or delete. Legacy `PRJ-XXXX_<slug>` folders found by code and renamed to new `<slug>_PRJ-XXXX` format transparently. |
| Discord notify | `sendProjectDiscord` does up to 3 attempts with progressive backoff (1.2s / 2.5s / 4s, Retry-After honoured, clamp bumped 5s → 9s). Detects Cloudflare 1015 in response body and bails the retry loop early (no point burning GAS time when per-IP cooldown won't clear). `doPost notifyProjectDiscord` echoes full diagnostic info in the response (`status`, `attempts`, `firstStatus`, `body`, `retried`) so the frontend can log what Discord said — GAS Cloud Logs are NOT recorded for browser-fetch calls (see `skills/deploy-gas.md` "Where the logs DO and DON'T appear"). `notifyProjectEmail` also surfaces send failures. |
| Diagnostics | New `testProjectDiscord()` function for manual editor-Run debugging — sends a labelled test embed and logs the full Discord response. Top-of-`doPost` trace log (`doPost: action=...`) for absolute-floor confirmation that the code path is being entered (visible only when called with OAuth token or from the editor). |

Until the redeploy lands, the QR button + rename hooks alert
"หา URL โฟลเดอร์ไม่สำเร็จ"; Discord notify still works but on the old
single-shot path. Everything else in the inbox is unaffected.

## Active external issue: Cloudflare 1015 cooldown on Discord webhook

The GAS server's shared egress IP is currently in Cloudflare's
penalty box for the Discord API (`/api/webhooks/*`). Caused by
sustained testing volume today (dozens of pings, many back-to-back).
Symptoms: `testProjectDiscord` returns `HTTP 429 / body "error
code: 1015"` from the editor; runtime calls all 3-retry and drop.

This is per-IP, not per-webhook — rotating the webhook URL won't
help. Recovers passively over 15-60 min of quiet. **Stop testing
Discord-firing actions** until it clears, then verify with one
`testProjectDiscord` run from the editor.

Longer-term, if this recurs frequently: move Discord notify off GAS
to a Cloudflare Worker / Supabase Edge Function (different egress
IP, dedicated to this app). See `mistakes.md` "Cloudflare 1015" for
the full writeup.

## Recent work landed today (one-line each, for context)

- `ฝ่าย` navbar entry → new tab-departments page (moved from เกี่ยวกับเรา); 10 dept cards drill into per-ฝ่าย tool lists. Three external sites (Notion, MDI, RT) ship as `#` placeholders pending real URLs from the user.
- Public read-only customer mirror of หนังสือโครงการ at `/projects-view` — reuses admin renderers via `role='customer'` so admin UI changes auto-mirror (zero duplication). Migration 0032 opens anon SELECT on projects + documents + files + types + settings. **Apply 0032 before users hit /projects-view.**
- Dept-specific links also mirrored into the เครื่องมือ launcher so search picks them up.
- Easy "คัดลอกรหัส" button on every project's admin detail header (uses the existing `[data-copy]` delegate).

## End-of-turn loop reminder

Every meaningful change should:
1. Update STATE.md if real state changed (branch HEAD, migrations,
   in-flight work, blocking issues). Don't append session narratives —
   `git log` is the archive.
2. Append to `.claude/rules/mistakes.md` if a new bug class was
   discovered.
3. Create / update `skills/*.md` if a repeatable workflow appeared.
4. Update README / docs/CONTEXT.md only if user-visible features,
   architecture, or build setup changed — skip for internal-only
   refactors / bugfixes / comment edits.

## Where to look next

| Looking for | Read |
|---|---|
| Project rules, file placement, end-of-turn loop | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Architecture, RLS, schema, deploy plumbing | `docs/CONTEXT.md` |
| Anti-patterns / bug post-mortems / sharp edges | `.claude/rules/mistakes.md` |
| API key hygiene | `.claude/rules/security.md` |
| Merge checklist (refactor → main) | `docs/MERGE-CHECKLIST.md` |
| Multi-step workflows | `skills/*.md` |
| Feature history | `git log --oneline --grep='<topic>'` |
| Who shipped what when | `git log --since=YYYY-MM-DD --oneline` |
| Earlier STATE.md snapshots | `docs/state-archive/*.md` |

## When STATE.md gets bloated again

If a future session balloons this file past ~200 lines, prune:

- Past session narratives → `docs/state-archive/YYYY-MM-DD.md` then
  rewrite STATE.md fresh.
- Big architecture write-ups → `docs/CONTEXT.md`.
- Reusable workflows → `skills/*.md`.
- New bug classes → `.claude/rules/mistakes.md`.
- Cross-conversation user facts → auto-memory under
  `/Users/xeno/.claude/projects/.../memory/`.

This file answers "what is true right now". Nothing else.
