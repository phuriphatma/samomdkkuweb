## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project with the required tables

### Installation

```bash
# Passport is no longer its own repository — it merged into samomdkkuweb
# on 2026-09-04 and lives at passport/ inside it.
git clone https://github.com/samomdkku/samomdkkuweb.git
cd samomdkkuweb
npm install          # one install covers both apps
npm run dev:passport # passport alone, or `npm run dev` for the main site
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=[https://your-project.supabase.co](https://your-project.supabase.co)
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens at `http://localhost:5173`. Hot-reloads on file changes.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview   # Preview the production build locally
```

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions from the SAMO IT team! If you want to add a new feature, fix a bug, or make changes to this repository, **please read our step-by-step Git guide first**:

👉 **[Read the CONTRIBUTING.md guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** 👈

Following this workflow ensures that you can safely test your code using Cloudflare Preview deployments without breaking the live app for other medical students.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on **Cloudflare Pages** connected to the GitHub repo.

### Production

Push to `main` branch → Cloudflare auto-builds and deploys to production.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your changes"
git push origin main
```

### Preview Deployments (Testing)

Push to **any non-main branch** → Cloudflare creates a preview deployment with a unique URL.

```bash
git checkout -b refactor
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: extract inline scripts to modules"
git push origin refactor
```

After pushing, check your **Cloudflare Pages dashboard** → **Deployments** tab for the preview URL (e.g. `https://refactor.your-project.pages.dev`).

Once tested and verified, merge into main:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge refactor
git push origin main
```

## Admin Access

Default admin credentials (change in production):

- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `1234`

## Database Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `activities` | Activity definitions (name, km, badge, department, sub-department, tokens) |
| `scans` | Records of user scans (user_id, activity_id, points_awarded) |
| `user_tiers` | Computed view of user totals, tiers, and visa status |
