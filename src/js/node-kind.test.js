// ==============================================
// TWO KINDS, AND NOTHING MAY QUIETLY WRITE A THIRD.
//
// `team_nodes.kind` is plain `text` with no check constraint and a default of
// 'role' — the database will accept any string at all and never complain. That
// is how three kinds became a live tree where 78 of 298 nodes carried a value
// (`department`) that nothing read and that half the tree disagreed about.
//
// Now the value DECIDES things — sibling order and the "แสดงถึง" rungs on the
// public chart (org-rung.js) — so a writer that emits an unknown kind no longer
// just picks the wrong icon: the node sorts as a ตำแหน่ง, and at the ฝ่าย rungs
// it disappears along with everything under it. Silently, on the public page.
//
// So this guard covers the WRITERS, in both languages the app writes in: the
// <select> a human picks from, and the JS literals the importers assign.
//
// TO CHECK IT GUARDS: put `<option value="department">แผนก</option>` back into
// the select in tab-team.html, or change ensurePath's middle-segment kind back
// to 'department', and watch the matching assertion fail. Then put it back.
