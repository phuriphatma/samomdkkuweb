// ผังรวม draws REPORTING: a ฝ่าย's sub-ฝ่าย hang off its head seat, and ระดับ 2
// hangs off ระดับ 1 (`chartParentage`). That is what a top-down canvas needs.
//
// The reporting parentage was applied to BOTH at one point, on the theory that
// one structure cannot drift. It can't — but nesting costs DEPTH, and on a page
// depth is vertical: measured on the live tree, แผนผัง went from 25,847px to
// 52,163px and max depth from 5 to 9, a staircase down the middle of an empty
// page.
//
// So the geometries differ and the ORDER does not. Both read `orderChildren` —
// ตำแหน่ง before ฝ่าย, ระดับ ascending — and `org-rung.test.js` holds the
// differential that says the seat sequence is the same one either way. That is

//               reflows from four columns to one. No canvas, no panning, no
//               horizontal scrollbar — this is the surface you read on a phone.
//   • ผังรวม  — THE CANVAS. ONE d3 chart over the whole organisation, hung off a
//               synthetic องค์กร root, with real connector lines and pan/zoom
//               (org-graph.js). Wide by construction; the แสดงถึง rung is what

// renderer and differed only in how the rows were grouped. Four buttons offered
// two pictures twice, and the pair that went is the pair whose survivor already
// does the job better at every width.
//
// The saved preference is MIGRATED rather than dropped: a reader whose last
