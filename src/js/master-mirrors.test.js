// master-mirrors.test.js — the ratchet for the `master` fold.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// `master` (migration 0111) is a rule implemented on BOTH sides of the wire, and
// this repo has now paid for that drift twice:
//
//   2026-08-17 — a master holder found the PR/VS "ไม่ส่งแจ้งเตือน" toggle and the
//                full VitalSound controls missing, because those gates read
//                `role === 'dev'` and a master is `role='user'`.
//   2026-08-18 — a master holder opened หนังสือโครงการ onto an EMPTY pane,
//                because `projectSeatRole()` read the raw `managed_project_seats`
//                column while SQL's `current_user_project_seats()` folds master
//                into all three seats. 36 of 41 master holders were affected.
//
// The second one is the interesting failure. `master-role-gates.test.js` was
// written after the FIRST report and swept for `role === 'x'` literals — and
// `projectSeatRole` has none. It does not GATE on a role, it PRODUCES one,
// upstream of every gate. A sweep shaped like the last bug could not see it.
//
// So this test is not another pattern sweep. It is a REGISTRY: it enumerates
// the SQL functions that special-case the master key, and fails when that set
// changes. A new one is not necessarily a bug — but it is always a decision
// about whether JS needs to learn the same fold, and this is what forces
// somebody to make it instead of discovering it from a user months later.

 * Every `public.<name>` function whose BODY mentions the master key.

 * Comments are stripped first: several migrations discuss master in prose while
 * defining something unrelated, and a guard satisfied by a comment is the
 * `confirm-modal.test.js` trap.
 *
 * The body is taken from the DOLLAR-QUOTED block (`as $$ … $$`), not "up to the
 * next function". The first version did the latter and reported a third name,
 * `get_claude_board` — it had swallowed the `create policy` statements that
 * follow it in 0154, which reference master but are not that function. Checked
 * against the live database (`pg_get_functiondef` over every function in
 * `public`, 2026-08-18): the live answer is exactly the two names below, and
 * `get_claude_board`'s real body does not contain the word. The scan is only
 * trustworthy because it was reconciled with the authority, not instead of it.
