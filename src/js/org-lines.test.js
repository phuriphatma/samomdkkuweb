// ============================================================
// org-lines.test.js — ผังสายงาน, the connector chart restored beside แผนผัง
// (2026-08-25).
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, and it is not "the new view should work"
//
// Restoring it meant lifting ~230 lines of CSS out of a deleted commit and
// re-hooking them onto markup whose neighbours had been renamed. The first
// attempt sliced that CSS BY LINE NUMBER, cut a comment in half, and shipped
// an unclosed `/*` — which silently swallowed the next three rules, including
// the one that draws the ฝ่าย dot and the one that lays out the station row.
// The page still rendered. It rendered WRONG, in a way that looks exactly like
// a design choice: names centred instead of left, no dot, no visible error
// anywhere. It was caught by looking at a screenshot, which is not a mechanism.
//
// So the assertions here are about the two properties that failure violated:
//
//   §A  the stylesheet PARSES — comments and braces balance. An unclosed
//       comment is the only CSS defect that can delete code you never touched.
//   §B  every class the renderer EMITS is STYLED. This is the real one: a rule
//       that got commented out, a selector left pointing at an old class name,
//       and a class nobody ever wrote a rule for are three different mistakes
//       with one symptom, and CSS reports none of them.
//
// §C guards the key mapping, which is the other thing a restore can silently
// break — the restored view historically owned `'chart'`, and `'chart'` now
// means the panel view.
//
// The ORDERING differential lives in org-rung.test.js, extended rather than
// duplicated: three views ordering one ฝ่าย is ONE claim.
