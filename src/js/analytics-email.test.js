// analytics-email.test.js — the อีเมลแจ้งเตือน panel must never show a
// confident number it cannot stand behind.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The owner asked "is 100 a day enough, and have we hit it?"
// Nobody could answer, because notify.js sends the email fire-and-forget
// (`callGAS(...).catch(() => {})`) and records nothing. Migration 0170 answers
// it by DERIVING the count from the notification fan-out — one in-app row per
// staff-seat holder, one email, same call.
//
// That derivation has exactly one failure mode, and it fails in the dangerous
// direction. In notify.js the two halves are gated SEPARATELY:
//
//     if (settings?.notify_uni_in_app !== false) { ...createNotification... }
//     if (settings?.notify_uni_email  !== false && to) { ...callGAS... }
//
// Switch the in-app half off and no rows are written while mail keeps going
// out. The panel would then read ZERO — "we send no email" — while email is
// being sent. A silent zero is worse than no panel, because a reader acts on
// it. So `in_app_enabled` rides along in the payload and the panel must SAY
// the number is untrustworthy.
//
// This is the repo's "a guard that fails green" shape, applied to a readout
// instead of a test: the ritual here is to feed the panel the state that
// breaks its assumption and require it to admit that, rather than render
// cleanly.
