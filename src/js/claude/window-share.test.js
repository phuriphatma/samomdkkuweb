// จองโควตา Claude, migration 0159 — the five things that would go wrong

// The bug 0159 fixed was invisible for a day: with 08:00–13:00 booked at 100%,
// the board happily accepted a booking at 06:00, whose 5-hour window swallows
// the first one. It was invisible because the guard was ARITHMETICALLY BUSY —
// it computed sessions, it raised on straddles, it capped percentages — and
// every one of those answers was about the wrong set of rows. Nothing here
// re-tests the arithmetic; tools/claude0159-window-share.sql does that live,
// in both directions, and was falsified against the old guard. These are the
// STRUCTURAL properties that a live proof cannot see.
