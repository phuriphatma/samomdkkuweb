// ==============================================
// `hidden` MUST WIN FROM OUR OWN STYLESHEET.
//
// The UA rule is `[hidden] { display: none }` with NO `!important`, so any
// author rule that sets `display` on the same element beats it and the
// attribute silently does nothing. The app does this in several places — the
// ปีการศึกษา picker, the ขยาย/ย่อทั้งหมด button and every ฝ่าย panel body on
// the public org chart all declare a `display` AND are toggled with
// `element.hidden = true`.
//
// It worked anyway, by ACCIDENT: Bootstrap's reboot ships
// `[hidden]{display:none!important}`, and index.html loads Bootstrap from
// cdn.jsdelivr.net. MEASURED in a headless browser with that one <link>
// blocked and nothing else changed:
//
//     Bootstrap CSS     .orgc-unit-body[hidden] computed    #orgBody height
//     ─────────────     ───────────────────────────────     ───────────────
//     loaded            display: none                          3,463 px
//     blocked           display: flex                         22,474 px   ← every ฝ่าย open
//     blocked, + fix    display: none                          3,318 px
//
// So the whole disclosure mechanism on that page hung on a third-party
// stylesheet arriving. A filtered campus network, a self-hosted Bootstrap at
// another version, or dropping the CDN would each turn it off — and the failure
// is CSS's usual silent one: nothing throws, the page just renders everything.
//
// TO CHECK THIS GUARD ACTUALLY GUARDS: delete the `[hidden]` rule from
// base.css, or drop its `!important`, and watch the matching assertion fail.
// Then put it back.
