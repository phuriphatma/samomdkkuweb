// ============================================================
// host-guard.test.js — the retired hosts redirect, and NOTHING ELSE does.
//
// Both entry HTMLs carry an inline script that forwards the two retired
// pages.dev deployments to /moved.html. Until 2026-08-27 it tested
// /\.pages\.dev$/ — ANY pages.dev host — which was correct while pages.dev
// meant "retired", and became a trap the moment previews were planned onto
// pages.dev (docs/TEAM-WORKFLOW.md §1 + D8): every per-PR preview URL would
// have bounced to the "we've moved" splash, and the cause would have looked
// like a broken deploy rather than a four-year-old redirect.
//
// This tests the REGEX THAT SHIPS, pulled out of the HTML — not a copy of it
// living in the test, which would just agree with itself. And it tests EVERY
// entry: fixing one and not the other is this repo's most repeated shape.
//
// ⚠️ SIX ENTRIES SINCE THE 2026-09-04 REPO MERGE, and the count is the point.
// Passport used to live in its own repository with its own copy of this guard,
// and its copy still tested /\.pages\.dev$/ — ANY pages.dev host — EIGHT DAYS
// after this one was narrowed, because no test could see across a repo
// boundary. Now all six are here.
//
// ⚠️ THE MERGE ALSO WIDENED WHAT EACH GUARD MUST CATCH, which is easy to miss.
// Passport is now served UNDER samoweb's hosts (/passport/), including the
// RETIRED ones. Its old predicate named only samomdkkupassport.pages.dev, so a
// visitor to samomdkkuweb.pages.dev/passport/ would have been served passport
// from a retired host with no bounce at all — against the dev database, with
// nothing saying so. All six entries therefore share ONE predicate naming all
// three retired hosts, and the last test below pins that they stay identical.
