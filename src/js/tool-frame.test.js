// ============================================================
// tool-frame.test.js — the guards for Lane B. docs/DEPT-TOOLS.md §8.1–8.2.
//
// ⛔ THE ONE THAT MATTERS is "the sandbox has no allow-same-origin". Everything
// that makes this lane safe — a ฝ่าย shipping HTML nobody reviews line by line,
// approved by a peer rather than the owner — rests on that single missing word.
// Adding it would look like a fix ("the frame can't read its own storage") and
// would silently delete the entire model.
//
// It is asserted on the RENDERED markup, never on the EMBED_SANDBOX constant:
// a guard written from the same list as the code can only ever confirm the
// list (`.claude/rules/mistakes.md`, class 7). What a browser acts on is the
// attribute in the DOM, so that is the subject.
//
// FALSIFICATION, run before committing: add `allow-same-origin` to
// EMBED_SANDBOX → the sandbox test goes red; put `localStorage.x = 1` in
// public/embed/starter/index.html → the folder test goes red; delete the
// starter's README `Owner:` line → the owner test goes red. All three were
// watched failing on the assertion named, then restored.
