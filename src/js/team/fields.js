// ==============================================
// TEAM FIELD RULES — pure, shared, no DOM and no network.
//
// รหัสนักศึกษา / ชั้นปี / สาขา are typed by hand in three places (the admin
// สมาชิก form, the CSV import, and — since the ตำแหน่งของฉัน card grew a
// self-edit — by the person themselves), and the same field arrives spelled
// four ways: `659999999-9`, `6599999999`, `ปี5`, `5 `, `md`, `M.D.`.
//
// Free text is why ตรวจสอบข้อมูล has findings nobody can act on: two rows for
// one human reading `MD` and `md` are a `drift` finding about nothing. So the
// canonical form is decided ONCE, here, and every writer normalises through it.
// Pure functions, unit-tested, imported by both entry points — the alternative
// is the same rule spelled slightly differently in three files, which is the
// class this repo has paid for most often.
//
// WHAT CANONICAL MEANS FOR EACH FIELD (decided from the live data, 405 rows):
//   • รหัสนักศึกษา — `659999999-9`. 380 of 383 non-empty rows already carry the
//     dashed form; it is what is printed on the KKU student card and what a
//     student writes on paper. The bare 10-digit form is accepted and converted,
//     never stored.
//   • ชั้นปี — a bare digit `1`–`6`. Live data is already clean (`1`–`5`), and
//     the field is now a chooser, so this only has to catch legacy text and
//     pasted values.
//   • สาขา — a code from the managed vocabulary (`team_majors`, seeded MD /
//     MDI / RT). Matched case-insensitively and ignoring dots, so `m.d.` lands
//     on `MD`. An unknown value is NOT silently dropped: it is kept verbatim so
//     an import can never blank a field, and ตรวจสอบข้อมูล can show it.
// ==============================================

// Thai numerals → Arabic. Lives in utils.js because this four-line rule had
// grown three copies; this file held one of them.

/**
 * A SUGGESTED ชื่อ / นามสกุล split for a row that has only a combined name.
 *
 * ⚠️ READ THIS BEFORE USING IT. This repo's standing rule is that nothing splits
 * a stored name — `house/io.js` refuses an entire CSV rather than guess, and
 * `name-split.test.js` fails the build on any module that reconstructs a split
 * from a combined string. This function is the ONE exception, and it is an
 * exception to the MECHANISM, not to the rule:
 *
 *   the rule is "no unreviewed guess is ever written".
 *
 * A CSV import has no human in the loop for 1,800 rows, so there the only safe
 * answer is to refuse. A member form has exactly one admin looking at exactly
 * one person, with the stored name printed beside the boxes — so there the safe
 * answer is to OFFER the split and let them correct it. Leaving the boxes blank
 * (the first attempt) was neither: it read as data loss on 399 rows and made
 * the split something nobody would ever fill in.
 *
 * Splits at the FIRST run of whitespace, which is right whenever the given name
 * is one word — including "สมชาย ณ อยุธยา", where the surname is the part with
 * the space. It is wrong when the GIVEN name has a space, and that is exactly
 * the case an admin can see and fix in the box.
 *
 * NEVER call this to build a patch. Call it to fill a form.
 *
 * @returns {{first: string, last: string}|null} null when there is nothing to
 *          suggest (no name, or a single word with no surname to separate).

 *   than storing it unparsed), and null for genuinely empty.
 *   `ok` is false when the digits could not be made to fit, which is what the
