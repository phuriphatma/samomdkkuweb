// ==============================================
// TEAM IDENTITY RULES — pure, shared, no DOM and no network.
//
// A person is stored once per ตำแหน่ง, so ~404 rows describe ~285 humans and
// each copy carries its own ชื่อเล่น / ชั้นปี / รูป / kkumail with nothing keeping
// them in step. These functions are the single definition of "who is one
// person, and what is unresolved about them".
//
// WHY IT LIVES IN ITS OWN FILE. It has THREE consumers now:
//   • the ตรวจสอบข้อมูล admin pane (./health.js),
//   • the ตำแหน่งของฉัน card on the PUBLIC site (../my-seat.js), which tells a
//     member what is wrong with their own record so they can fix it,
//   • tools/team-identity-dryrun.mjs, which re-states the same rule in SQL.
// health.js imports ../utils.js and ./api.js, so the public card importing it
// would have pulled the admin module and a database client into the public
// bundle — and re-deriving the rules in the card would have been a THIRD
// implementation of a rule health.js's own header already warns is implemented
// twice. One definition, imported by both.
//
// THE RESOLUTION RULE:
//   1. rows sharing a valid kkumail                 → one person
//   2. a row with NO kkumail joins the email-person holding its รหัส, when
//      EXACTLY ONE such person exists                → one person
//   3. rows with NO kkumail sharing a รหัส          → one person
//   4. anything else                                 → its own person
// Keep it in step with tools/team-identity-dryrun.mjs; if they disagree, the
// tool is the reference because it sees every row with no client in between.
//
// ⚠️ RULE 2 IS A SECOND PASS, and it has to be. It was written as part of a
// single-pass key (`em ? 'e:'+em : sid ? 's:'+sid : 'r:'+id`), which quietly
// made it apply only to no-email rows joining EACH OTHER — a no-email row could
// never reach the email-keyed person holding the same รหัส. Reported live:
//
//   "รหัส 663070019-9 2 คน … ชญาภา เลาหะตานนท์ chayapa.l@kkumail.com …
//    ชญาภา เลาหะตานนท์ ไม่มีอีเมล … this person is the same person but it
//    detects wrong because no email"
//
// Exactly right, and it is the fail-open shape (mistakes class 2): a row with
// no address has no ASSERTED identity, and treating "unknown" as "a different
// human" is the unsafe reading. The safe one is that it resolves to the one
// person who claims that รหัส, or to nobody.
//
// AND IT STILL CANNOT MERGE TWO REAL PEOPLE. 0108's case — `673070332-6`, one
// mistyped รหัส worn by two humans — has an email on BOTH rows, so both are
// email-keyed and rule 2 never looks at them. Where a no-email row's รหัส is
// claimed by TWO email-people, the row stays separate: that ambiguity is the
// finding, not something to guess through.
