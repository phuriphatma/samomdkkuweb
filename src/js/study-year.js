// ==============================================
// ชั้นปี / รุ่น — the ONE implementation, for the WHOLE app.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT IN house/ ANY MORE.
//
// It used to live in `src/js/house/fields.js`, because ระบบบ้าน was the only
// system that computed a ชั้นปี. ทีม SAMO STORED one instead, in
// `team_members.year`, and the two answers drifted apart exactly as that file's
// own comment predicted they would:
//
//   "team_members.year is still that column (399 rows, and nothing anywhere in
//    this repo has ever bumped it — verified by grep, so every August all 399
//    quietly become last year's answer)."
//
// Reported, one August later: "i've tested changing my student id to
// 603070316-0 — it shows ชั้นปี 5 on main web, จบแล้ว in ระบบบ้าน (ปี10), ปี5 in
// teamsamo. the data become not syncing". Nine members were showing a ชั้นปี
// exactly one year behind the truth and nobody could have noticed, because the
// only place the two answers appear side by side is one person's own card.
//
// A rule that two systems need does not belong inside one of them. Living under
// `house/` is what made "ทีม SAMO should use this too" read as a layering
// violation rather than as the obvious thing — so the rule moved up, and
// `house/fields.js` re-exports it so no caller had to change.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE RULE
//
//   ชั้นปี = ปีการศึกษา − ปีที่เข้า + 1 + year_offset
//
// ปีที่เข้า is read off the รหัสนักศึกษา and re-derived whenever the รหัส moves
// (0128 for students, 0145 for the registry). ปีการศึกษา is an admin-set value
// (0141). `year_offset` is a DIFFERENCE — ลาพัก / เรียนซ้ำ / จบช้า — set once by
// the person and correct in every later year without maintenance.
//
// "SHOULD CHANGING รหัสนักศึกษา CHANGE ชั้นปี?" — asked by the owner, whose
// instinct was no. Yes, it must: the รหัส is where ปีที่เข้า comes from, so a
// corrected รหัส and an unchanged ชั้นปี would leave the record asserting that
// someone who entered in 2560 is in their fifth year in 2569. What must NOT be
// recomputed is the part that is genuinely about the person, and that is exactly
// what `year_offset` is. The instinct is right; the offset is what satisfies it.
//
// THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO SQL TWIN. Nothing server-side gates on ชั้นปี, so SQL
// stores the ingredients and this does the arithmetic — one implementation of
// one rule, which is the class this repo has paid for most.
