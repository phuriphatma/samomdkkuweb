// proof-targeting.test.js — a proof must run against the database it was SENT
// to, and must be able to run with no `.env.local` at all.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. On 2026-08-29, `VITE_SUPABASE_URL=$SUPABASE_DEV_URL
// npm run proofs` — the targeting documented in db-query.mjs's own header —
// sent the 17 `.sql` proofs to samo-dev and `proj0092-seat-parity.mjs` +
// `grant0093-reads.mjs` to PRODUCTION, and printed ONE GREEN SUMMARY over the
// mixture. Both files parsed `.env.local` themselves, so `process.env` never
// reached them. The sibling that had already been fixed (db-query.mjs) records
// the same bug in its header; the fix was never carried to the others.
//
// Two implementations of one rule drift (class 6), and this one drifted in the
// dangerous direction: the mixed run LOOKED clean.
//
// `run-proofs.mjs` now reads each proof's own `→ project:` announcement back
// and fails any proof that answered from the wrong database — that is the
// mechanism, and it catches a proof nobody has written yet. These tests are the
// cheap ratchet underneath it:
//
//   1. no proof reads `.env.local` directly — it goes through env-lib, which
//      lets `process.env` win and treats the file as optional;
//   2. env-lib really does tolerate the file's absence (CI has none — without
//      this, 21 of 23 proofs failed a CI-shaped run holding valid credentials);
//   3. the runner's ref check reads a REAL announcement, not a hopeful regex.
//
// The subject is derived from run-proofs.mjs's own PROOFS list rather than
// re-listed here, so a proof added there is covered the day it is added — never
// write a guard from the same list the code came from.
